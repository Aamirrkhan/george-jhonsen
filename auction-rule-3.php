                        Placing bids on our NSE auctions is simple and easy. Over 95% of our members bid via email, but you can also submit bids by snail-mail if necessary. If you choose to bid by mail, you only need to submit a list of the item numbers and your bid amount for each item. Also make sure to include your name and member number.
                        By far the easiest and most efficient way to place bids on our auctions is by email! Not only is it the fastest and most accurate, but for those that supply us a list done in excel, all we have to do is copy that list directly into our auction bid system. There’s less chance for errors and a lot less work for our auction staff. The other benefit of email bidding is that you receive a confirmation that your bids have been received and entered into the auction system.
                        <strong></strong>
                        This next statement is very important. When you place a bid on our auctions, you have entered into a binding contract. That means that if you are awarded any item at your bid price (winner or “dupe” award), you are expected to honor that bid and pay for those items…period. Again, once a bid has been submitted and entered into the system, it is a “firm” bid and cannot be withdrawn. The bottom line here is…”be careful”. Don’t make mistakes when you are bidding. Double-check your bids before you submit them. If you are not sure that a particular item is the one you want…ask before you bid! You will be held responsible for any errors made while bidding. Unfortunately, failure to honor any bids placed by a NSE member will result in the forfeiture of all auction privileges and possible termination from the Organization.
                        <strong></strong>
                        At the conclusion of each auction, the results are tallied and posted on our web site. It usually takes at least 24-36 hours after the auction close for the results to be posted. If you do not have access to the NSE website, maybe a friend can download the results for you. Or, you can also go to your local public library and view the results at no charge. If you want a hard-copy of the results, current auction participants can send in $1.00 along with their bids.
                        <strong></strong>
                        We prefer that all bidders maintain an active Credit Card on file for any winning bids. This way, we can charge your card and ship your winnings within a few days of the auction close. This saves us a lot of time and paperwork and also saves us money! We accept Visa, MasterCard and Discover (no American Express). Please note…All non-USA bidders must have a valid email address and use a Credit Card for payment. No bids can be placed without this information on file. Most of our auction “players” use Credit cards for auction payments and we do appreciate it. However, on monthly auction purchase over $1,000.00, we may request to be paid by check or money order. If you can accommodate that request… great!
                        <strong></strong>
                        Winning bidders who have an email address on file receive an “e-invoice with their amount due (if they do not pay via credit card on file). A confirming reply of the email message and prompt payment of the total due is expected. If the member does not have email access, they must supply us with a daytime telephone number so that we can call them with their invoice amount due. We do not mail invoices. It simply takes too long to receive payments. All non credit card payments are due upon receipt of the e-Invoice and we must receive all payments within 10 days thereafter. All member/bidders receive a “paid” invoice with their auction shipments.
                        Another great feature of our auction system is the awarding of duplicate items. In certain cases where an auction item receives more than one substantial bid, and we have another exact-same item in our inventory, the system will award that duplicate item to the second-high bidder if that bidder matches the winning price. It would not be fair to the winning bidder (or the seller) to do it any other way.
                        <strong></strong>
                        After all bookkeeping and invoices are completed, the real fun begins…packing! Our NSE auctions and sales usually generate between 75 and 150 outgoing shipments each month! That’s not a lot if you had all month to do it, but in our case, we have to have all the auction winnings “out the door” within a few days of the auction closing. Please note that auction shipments to credit card participants are shipped first, within a few days of an auction closing. Shipments being paid via check or Money Order are shipped after receipt of payment. Also, if your shipping address is different than where we send your magazine, we need to know that BEFORE the auction closes.
                        <strong></strong>
                        It takes a minimum of three (3) people over 40 hours to final-inspect, pack, label and ship auction items from a single auction. We have developed special packing techniques that allow us to ship almost anything to anyone in the world…without damage or loss! And, as additional protection for the new owner, we insure every shipment for “full value” (over $100.00). We also maintain an additional third-party insurance policy that covers whatever the USPS does not cover. That way, all NSE buyers are covered one way or another in case of accident or loss. Also, do not ask us “not to insure” your shipment. If it’s over $100.00 in value, it has to be insured. That is our long-standing rule and it’s not worth the minimal savings that might be realized.
                        When the auction shipment arrives at a Member’s home/office, the Member then has three (3) days to inspect the items and report any problems. This limited inspection time is necessary due to the fact that all “problems” must be resolved by the return deadline (maximum 14 days after the auction closing date). If any item needs replacement (for whatever reason), that item needs to travel back to us and then back to the new owner before the return deadline.
                        <strong></strong>
                        One of the key reasons that our NSE auctions are so popular is our exclusive NSE “Certified Collector-Quality®” guaranty. All of our bidders can bid with total confidence and peace of mind knowing that the NSE is standing behind every item listed on our auction lists. Our guaranty states that “all auction items have been inspected (more than once) for accuracy and are certified to be in NSE Grade 1 or Grade 2 condition. The new purchaser will be allowed to return any item found to be other than described. That item will be corrected, replaced or refunded (including return shipping costs), but this is done at the sole discretion of the NSE AuctionMaster.”
                        <strong></strong>
                        Before any items may be returned, a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) must be issued.  It is important that you contact our office immediately upon receipt of your items id there are any problems. If an item is deemed to meet our return criteria, an RMA will be granted, but only up to three (3) days after receipt of your shipment, and no later than the return deadline posted on all auction lists. In most cases, when a Member contacts us with a potential problem, we can resolve most of them instantly on the phone, as miss-information is the probable cause and there’s really nothing wrong at all.
