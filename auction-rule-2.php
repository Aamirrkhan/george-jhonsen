                        Each month our entire Membership receives notice of that month’s auction and/or sale list posting via email. After that notice is received, NSE members can easily go to the NSE website, view the list, and download a copy for themselves. NSE members without computers or Internet access can still receive a mailed paper copy of the list as long as they are actively participating in the auctions. We no longer can afford to print and mail paper copies of these large auction lists to members who do not participate on a regular basis.
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong>
                            These monthly lists usually contain over 700 items. The lists are presented in a spreadsheet style format that is very easy to follow. There is also a “cover sheet” that contains all the important dates for that auction like the closing date, payment due date (if a credit card is not on file) and the return item deadline date. Page two (which also precedes the auction list) describes some of the “featured items” included on the list.
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong>
                            The auction list is made up of ten columns of information, all of which are important to the bidders and/or sellers. This year, our auction list format has changed slightly due to our migration to a new “custom-built” auction management software system. The first column is labeled “code” (short for seller code). It lets our sellers know which items are theirs. Some bidders also like to bid on items from certain sellers based on other items they purchased previously from that same seller. The second column is labeled “mfg” that signifies the manufacturer of the listed item. We are using abbreviations of the various vendors’ names (e.g. “MTL”=Micro Trains). We plan to list these “vendor abbreviations” in the magazine and on our website, but most NSE members figure them out on their own. The third column is simply labeled “model #”. In years past, our lists have contained “new number” and “old number” columns referring to the old and new numbering sequences used for Micro Trains cars. We have now streamlined our lists and use only a single model number by each item. Our forth column, labeled “BL” denotes that the model number for that particular item is the old Kadee “blue label” model number used only during the first couple years Kadee cars were produced.
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong> 
                            The fifth column is labeled “description”. This one is pretty self-explanatory…the road name (or description) of the item. The sixth column is the “road #” of the item. This column further identifies a particular item where there might be more than one road number produced. The seventh column header…”variation” is very important to collectors. Within an individual item there may be several variations other than just a different road number. Sometimes it’s the color; sometimes it’s the door style, or what ever. The “variation” column is where this very important information is listed. With very little space available to list all the important attributes of each item, we have to make every effort to provide the most information that we can so bidders know exactly what they are bidding on.
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong> 
                            The eighth column is the “min bid” column. Here is stated the minimum amount that can be bid on any particular item. We’ll talk more about minimum bids later. The ninth column is the “item” column. This column is simply a numerical list of all the items included on a particular auction list. It is very important as it determines the specific item that a bid is being placed. Please do not use the road name nor the road number or some other descriptive words when bids are being submitted. The people who enter all these bids (our NSE auction staff) only know the Item number…and the bid amount…period! That brings us to the tenth and final column…”your bid”. This is where bidders enter their bid amount.
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong>
                            Before we proceed, we need to discuss “minimum” bids. As stated above, the minimum bid is the lowest amount that will be accepted for any item listed on our auctions. How are these minimum bids established? Originally, the minimum bid for any item was set at about 50% of the value as listed in the various reference guides available in the marketplace and/or certain other credible value data. However, as the market dictates price, the minimum bid amount fluctuates more with the demand for the item versus some percentage of the published value in the Guides. The minimum bid values for packs is at least the combined minimum values of the individual items in the pack, or the value of the pack divided by the number of cars in the pack. Obviously there are certain exceptions to this “pack rule” where the pack price is at a large premium versus the separate car values. Brass models, select rare items, locomotives and many other items are priced at the low-end of current market values. These prices are established after on-going consultation with a panel of brass model experts who are also NSE members and looking at other sales data.
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong>
                            There is one key exception to our “minimum bid” formula. There are many items listed in the Guides where the all-time high values are way “out of touch” with the item’s true worth. In some cases, even using 30%, 40% or 50% of these exaggerated high values puts these items above what people will pay for them (market value). These erroneous high values were established some years ago when several competing mail-order retailers and the N-Scale Enthusiast all ran monthly paper auctions. Bidding errors occurred. Result posting errors occurred. Then, the Guides picked up many of these errors. Some of them were corrected after the fact, but many of them still remain. Therefore, some of the valuation data is still invalid and we instead use current establishes selling prices as our minimum.
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong>

                            Another bigger problem is that items that are listed with “un-real” minimums will just sit on our auction lists and not receive any bids at all! The purpose of our NSE auctions is to sell products for our members…to our members! Therefore, we monitor the bidding activity of all listed items. Since we have access to and use the most sophisticated N-Scale auction management system in the world, our results data over time establishes real values for our listed items.
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong>
                            
                            When an item does not receive any bids after several listings, the minimum bid is lowered to a point where we believe it will receive bids. If that item still does not receive any bids, its minimum bid is lowered even further in an effort to solicit bidding activity.
