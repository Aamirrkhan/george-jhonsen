                        Selling N and Z-Scale items on our NSE auctions is easy! First, just like being a bidder on our auctions, all sellers must also be NSE members in good standing in order to sell items on our lists. All qualified items submitted for our collector-quality auctions are to be in NSE Grade 1 or Grade 2 condition including the packaging. Any items (including the packaging) found to be less than Grade 2 condition, and contain minor correctible defects such as broken stirrups will be corrected at the seller’s expense. If the item cannot easily be corrected, the item will be returned to the seller at the seller’s expense including a $2.00 per item failed inspection fee. Under no circumstances will any Grade 3 or less item (a used item) be “restored” in any way to achieve Grade 2 or higher condition nor will they be sold in our NSE auctions, or our sales.
                        <strong></strong>
                        Once submitted, items may not be withdrawn by the seller for any reason. Certain rare exceptions do exist, but in all cases a 25.0% return fee (based on published Guide values) will be assessed on all items returned per the seller’s request. Items already committed to auctions or sales within a 60-90 day period of the return request date must run in those auctions and/or sales and are not immediately available for return until after those lists expire and the items have not been sold.
                        <strong></strong>
                        There is no limit on how many items each member may submit. However, lists of less than fifty items are discouraged (unless they are very valuable) as our cost to set-up a seller account for that member will far exceed any revenue generated for the N-Scale Enthusiast.
                        <strong></strong>
                        All potential sellers should first call us on the telephone during normal business hours to discuss what they want to sell. Then they should prepare a list of the items and submit that list to us for review and acceptance. It is important to include any variation data (clip-on trucks, Narrow-Rib door, etc.). If convenient, please use the various Reference Guides that are available in the marketplace. A list of those Guides is posted on our NSE website. Ideally, this list should be prepared in an Excel-type spreadsheet format, but other formats are acceptable (including hand-written lists if necessary). Sellers do not have to establish starting values for their submitted items. Our auction database system automatically calculates these values based on a variety of criteria using all of the current, verifiable market data available.
                        <strong></strong>
                        The list should be sent to us via email (our first choice), or snail-mail if necessary. Upon receipt, we will review the list and respond with any questions we may have. Remember, all items must be in collector-quality Grade 1 or Grade 2 condition including the packaging to be considered for our collector auction and sales. After we have completed our review process, we will inform you which items to send to us.
                        <strong></strong>
                        Before you pack the auction items, sellers should inspect all of the items one more time to make sure they are in Grade 1 or Grade 2 condition. You should remove any non-factory applied stickers or markings and replace any scratched, cracked or discolored boxes and lids to avoid being charged for those services. You should also add the published NSE Special Run ID Number to all MicroTrains Special Run cars. Note: a complete list of all NSE ID numbers listed to date is available on our NSE website. Use a small Avery sticker (or Post-It note) on the end of the box to accomplish this. Do NOT write the ID number directly on the insert label or the box!
                        <strong></strong>
                        You should then carefully pack and ship these items and get them to us as soon as possible as we do NOT “reserve” positions on our auction lists. It’s a FIFO (first-in, first-out) system. That means that the sooner we receive the items, the sooner those items will appear on our auction lists. However, all approved shipments must be received no later than 30 days after the approval date. Upon receipt of all auction items, our team of “experts” will carefully inspects every one of item. We have permission to use the most-comprehensive N-Scale variation database in the world to assure authenticity of every item we list. No other auction venue in the world has this capability! As we stated above, any minor correctible defects found on the items (or packaging) will be corrected at the seller’s expense.
                        <strong></strong>
                        Before a seller’s items are entered into our auction system, the seller is issued a “seller code”. This is a 3-letter code (ABC for example) that is listed with all of the seller’s items when they appear on our auction lists. It’s an easy way for all of our sellers to see just how many of “their” items are appearing on a particular list.
                        Once the items that meet our high standards have been inspected and authenticated, they are entered into our state-of-the-art auction management system. This system controls all aspects of our collector auctions from inventory control to seller payments. Once entered, a detailed list of all of the seller’s items is transmitted to him/her for confirmation. This is the time that any discrepancies must be resolved and corrections made. No items will be sold until we receive approval from the seller that all items are accurately listed and complete. Once approved, this list becomes the “bible” for that seller. Any disputes (we have not had any yet) that arise in item counts, road numbers, etc. will only be reconciled using the seller’s approved “master list”.
                        <strong></strong>
                        Once entered, all items appear on our NSE auction lists in the order they were entered. We have a rule that no two specimens of the exact same item will appear in two consecutive auctions. Therefore, when one of them runs, the second one is pushed backed at least two auction to meet our “no two in a row” rule. Sellers may submit multiple copies of the same item. However, if another seller submits one of the same items, the new seller’s item will jump ahead of all but the first unsold item from the first seller, thus allowing more sellers to participate and be fair to all of our members. After a seller’s items have been inspected, accepted, and the list approved by the seller, all the seller has to do now is sit back, relax and wait for their items to appear. Our NSE auction staff does all the work (a lot of work).
                        <strong></strong>
                        As each auction is closed, all sold items are invoiced, packed and shipped to their new owners. The new purchaser has three (3) days from receipt of their auction shipment to file any claims for damage, etc. Once that period has lapsed, the sale is considered final. Any unsold items from one particular auction are automatically placed in the next available auction on our schedule. Unsold items are NOT returned to the sellers unless the seller specifically makes that request. If so, the 25.0% return fee (as described above) will first be collected, plus the cost of shipping.
                        <strong></strong>
                        Approximately four (4) weeks after the conclusion of each auction or sale, sellers receive a detailed recap of their sales transactions and a check for the proceeds of their sold items. The recap details total sales, fees and any other charges associated with each seller. This process continues each month until all of a seller’s items are sold.
                        <strong></strong>
                        Our selling fees remain at a very reasonable 25.0% of the selling price for all items. Sellers are also responsible for the selling fees and shipping costs associated with any returned items based on our published “collector-quality” guaranty. (Note, last season we only experienced three returned items, and all of them were due to shipping damage). Also, as stated earlier, any charges for correcting minor defects will be deducted from a seller’s proceeds as well. When you think about what eBay, etc. now charges including their Paypal and credit card fees, and all the time and expense you have to absorb yourself, our fees are quite a bargain! It’s also important to remember that unlike other auction venues where all the profits go into someone’s pocket, any profits we may generate all go right back into the N-Scale Enthusiast® to make it a better Organization for you.
                        <strong></strong>
                        We know that more than half of our NSE Membership use our N-Scale auctions as a means of finding and/or disposing of their N-Scale items or collections on an on-going basis. We list and sell over 10,000 “collector-quality” items each year. Our auctions have become the “benchmark” standard for the majority of the N-Scale collecting community in the entire world. We attract the best quality items. We attract the best selection. That’s why our NSE auctions are called “the best auctions on the planet®!”
                        <strong></strong>
                        One final note…we refer to “NSE Grade 1 and Grade 2” condition for items that appear in our auctions. Many people may not know what that means. If you have a copy of the September/October 2002 Collector (now Enthusiast) magazine, please re-read the article “What is Collectible?” for a complete description of our NSE grading system. This article is also available on our NSE website at www.
                        <strong></strong>
