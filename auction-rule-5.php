                                Over the course of a single season well over half of our 2,100+ members will place one or more bids on our collector-quality auction lists. In any single auction we have had up to almost 400 bidders. In each case, that is good news for our member-sellers as our bidders are looking for quality N and Z-Scale items and are willing to pay a fair price to purchase them.

                                Usually only a few months, but sometimes longer. We try to only accept items that will appear in the next several auctions, but sometimes the seller waits to send his items to us. By then, we have already received the same items from other sellers (remember, first-in, first-out and no reserved positions), thus moving this seller’s items further down the waiting list.

                            If you study carefully what eBay charges, you will find that for most items the charges will exceed 15% of the selling price (including credit card fees, etc.). And then the seller has to do all the work of listing, answering questions, waiting (or hoping) the buyer pays, processing those payments, packing, shipping and dealing with any and all problems that always arise on each and every item they attempt to sell. Most serious collector/sellers have better things to do with their time. Twenty percent is cheap when you consider what’s involved! eBay is great for used stuff or when you have a lot of time on your hands, but when it comes to collector-quality N and Z-Scale, buyers choose our N-Scale Enthusiast auctions every time.

                            I thought that the “starting bids” on our N-Scale Enthusiast auctions were set at 50% of the all-time high values. Why do many have lower starting bids?

                            In many cases the items start at about the 50% level, but in recent years a more-honest “market value” formula has been used to establish many of our starting bids. In years past when other non-NSE auction venues attempted to compete with us, a significant number of “unconfirmed” (and questionable) high values were established on items…well above the items’ true values. The Pricing Guides posted these results and inflated their true values to a point where no one would bid on them. The answer was to first identify these items (several hundred MicroTrains alone), and then reduce their starting values to a level where demand would increase to equal the supply available in the marketplace. That’s why many of our auction listings have “starting values” well below the 50% of all-time highs that appear in the Guides.

                            Our auctions are not intended to make a profit, but are not intended to lose money either. The costs involved with printing and mailing the lists, inspecting and cataloging all item items, shipping and all the assorted bookkeeping, communications and computer work needed to keep our auctions running smooth is huge! We employ four people (although part-time) just to keep up with all the work that’s necessary to bring our members the high-quality auctions they expect. When all the bills are paid at the end of the year, there’s only a small profit remaining and that helps keep down the cost to you for membership and the other benefits you receive.
