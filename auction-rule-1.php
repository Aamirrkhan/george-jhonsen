                            Every year we publish our auction and sale rules and procedures so our members have a clear understanding of the entire N-Scale Enthusiast® auction and sale process. We encourage all NSE members to read these next paragraphs to fully understand just how our members-only, silent auctions work. Even if you do not plan to buy or sell through our auctions and sales, it is still important to know how our auctions and sales differ from all others and the steps we take to ensure our member/bidders that they are only bidding/buying NSE “Certified Collector-Quality”® N-Scale and Z-Scale items.

                            <strong></strong>
                            Our NSE auctions and sales are offered as an exclusive benefit of NSE Membership. All buyers and sellers must be N-Scale Enthusiast members in order to participate. We now have three (3) different types of auctions and sales for our NSE members to participate in. First, our NSE "Classic" auctions contain mostly five years and older (based on retirement date) MicroTrains cars, selected other collectible-quality items from other manufacturers, new condition custom-painted locomotives, brass models (other than those listed on our Premier auctions), most NN-3 and Z-Scale items. Second, our periodic sale events contain newer out of stock MicroTrains cars that have not yet achieved full "Classic" stature, other new, but sold out items from various manufacturers, overstock locomotives, etc. And third, our wildly popular Dutch auctions target our many NSE runner members and feature overstock MicroTrains cars (great for running), other new items from various manufacturers, building kits, track, etc. There’s something for everyone!
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong>
                            Our NSE “Classic” auctions are unique as they are silent (or blind) auctions unlike the online auctions such as eBay. It takes a certain amount of skill, research and some education to get the “feel” of our auctions. We recommend that all auction participants get access to one or more of the N-Scale reference guides available in the marketplace and study them thoroughly before you bid on our auctions. NSE Members can also view our past auction results by going to our website (www.nscaleenthusiast.com) and clicking on the “auctions” tab. From there you can select the various posted results for review.
                            <br>
                            <strong></strong>
                            NSE auctions and/or sales run monthly throughout the year. The closing date for all of our NSE auctions is toward the end of each month. Exact closing dates are posted as each list is published. Some auction closing dates may be extended at the sole discretion of the Auction Master. The N-Scale Enthusiast runs approximately ten auctions and four sales per year although this number may vary slightly from year to year. We also run our Dutch auctions from time to time as inventories allow.
