                    <p>Where do we go next? — One of the questions I am often asked are how do we pick the convention location. The real answer to this question is you, the NSE membership. A few years ago we conducted an online survey that helped us modify our convention to fit the needs our membership. Its time again to do a survey and pick the next convention locations. As part of our NSE web site there is now a permanent tab on the main page that you can use to email your preference for convention sites. You can also tell us what you are interested in seeing. If you want to offer yourself, your club, or business as a anchor let us know. From time to time I will report what locations are being suggested as future sites.</p>

                    <p>The N Scale Enthusiast Conventions are full of traditions and friendships and we continue to create them. When we were but a young group, we started doing the things that our members wanted, and that developed into a set of standards that have become a loose framework for all of our conventions. This is not to say that we do not vary, as our group has grown with new members and new ideas that we try to incorporate into the schedule. However, the basic schedule for the convention hasn't changed dramatically in years, and the events are pretty much what folks have come to expect. Yes, we switch days now and again to accommodate an attraction’s availability, but we pretty much stick to the same kind of schedule throughout. We do make exceptions for times when we can be the “National N Scale Convention” in association with another N Scale groups.</p>
